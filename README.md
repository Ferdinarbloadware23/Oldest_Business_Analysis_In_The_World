SELECT 
		b.business,
		b.year_founded,
		c.continent,
		c.country
FROM 
	businesses AS b
JOIN 
	countries AS c
ON b.country_code = c.country_code
WHERE
	(b.year_founded, c.continent) IN (
	SELECT

	 c2.continent
	FROM
	 businesses AS b2
	JOIN
	 countries AS c2 
	ON b2.country_code = c2.country_code
	GROUP BY
